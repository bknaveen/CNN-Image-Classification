The code implements training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here's a brief breakdown of what it accomplishes:

1. Data Preparation
Dataset Loading: Loads CIFAR-10 training and testing datasets using PyTorch's datasets.CIFAR10.
Transforms: Applies ToTensor() transformation to convert images to PyTorch tensors.
Data Loaders: Creates DataLoader objects for efficient mini-batch processing during training and testing.
2. Model Definition
Defines a custom CNN architecture using PyTorch's nn.Module.
The network includes:
Two convolutional layers (Conv2d) with ReLU activation.
MaxPooling (MaxPool2d) layers for spatial down-sampling.
Fully connected (linear) layers with dropout for classification.
3. Training Setup
Loss Function: Uses Cross-Entropy Loss (nn.CrossEntropyLoss) suitable for multi-class classification.
Optimizer: Uses Adam optimizer (torch.optim.Adam).
Device: Utilizes GPU if available; otherwise, falls back to CPU.
4. Training Loop
Splits the training set into training and validation subsets.
For each epoch:
Performs forward and backward passes on the training data.
Computes training and validation losses and accuracy.
Logs the progress.
5. Output
Displays epoch-wise training and validation losses along with accuracies.
Tracks metrics in train_his.
Observations
Model Performance:

Accuracy increases steadily during the initial epochs but plateaus as the model overfits.
Training loss decreases significantly, but validation loss starts increasing around epoch 20, indicating overfitting.
Suggestions:

Use data augmentation to improve generalization.
Apply learning rate scheduling to adjust the learning rate dynamically.
Experiment with regularization (e.g., dropout rates, weight decay).
Reduce the number of epochs or use early stopping to prevent overfitting
